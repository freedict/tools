-- | Modify value and also give out the new value.
--   Similar to `updateLookupWithKey' from `Data.Map.Strict'.
modifyLookup :: Ord k => (Maybe a -> a) -> k -> Map k a -> (a, Map k a)

-- Note that (,) is an instance of Functor, where the first argument remains
-- constant upon `fmap'.  (This is why the following works; v' is passed
-- through.)  See also the documentation of `alterF'.
modifyLookup f = Map.alterF $ \ v -> let v' = f v in (v', Just v')


-- Notes:
--  * Computation is wrapped in the IdState monad.
--    * This is to allow for the distribution of unique identifiers, which
--      should be of the form `HW.n'. where `HW' is the headword and `n' is
--      a number unique for that headword--naturally chosen as the entry's
--      rank in the left-to-right order of headwords of the same name.
--    * The IdState monad in particular is a MonadFix, which does allow to
--      not only distribute identifiers using a state, but also to access
--      identifiers of "later" to be constructed entries.
--      * In short, MonadFix allows for bidirectional flow of information,
--        albeit the state is only transferred left-to-right.
--      * We use this to provide entries that stem from the same line with
--        references to one another--also to later ones.
--        * Alternatively, one could have separated this in two steps
--          (labeling, translating), requiring an intermediate datatype (or
--          some Maybe values) and a whole new set of (trivial) AST traversing
--          functions.
--    * See also: doc/thesis.pdf
--  * There may be several orthographically identical headwords in a line.
--  * Concatenating reference lists all around (often the shorter to the longer
--    list) is not very efficient.  To keep the order of the references,
--    something like this is required though.
--    * Alternative: Use a queue or a difference list.
--    * Note that the lists are usually quite small.


-- | Convert a Ding AST to TEI AST.
--   Errors when the result contains no entries.  (The FreeDict XML schema
--   requires at least one entry.)
--   Note that the existance of a line in the Ding does not imply the
--   existance of an entry in the corresponding TEI.
--    - The Ding is permitted to contain empty lines - " :: " .

-- Notes:
--  * We want to provide `convEntry' with references (identifiers) from both
--    left and right of it.
--    * Typically, monadic computations would only allow to pass such
--      information from left to right.
--      * Monads being instances of MonadFix, however, effectively are stripped
--        of this restriction.
--        * MonadFix has mfix, which can--analogously to fix for
--          cyclic let-expressions--be used to have "information flow
--          backwards"; particularly there may also be apparent cyclic
--          statements.
--    * We obtain references from the left, which we pass both to
--      convEntry and the recursive convEntries call.
--      * convEntry additionally obtains the references from the right,
--        as produced by the recursive convEntries call.
--      * The recursive convEntries call additionally gets the reference
--        resulting from the convEntry call--as it also stems from left of
--        the recursively to be processed entries.
--      * Note that the order of reference concatenation somewhat matters;
--        we'd like to keep them in order.
--  * We could have only passed around TEI entries, these contain the
--    identifiers.
