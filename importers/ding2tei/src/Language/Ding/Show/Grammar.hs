{-|
 - Convert grammar annotations to strings, as they might occur in the Ding
 - dictionary.  Note that they generally have a different representation in
 - TEI.
 -
 - The functions herin are both used by the pretty printer, but also by the
 - parser, to convert grammar keywords identified in the lexer back to their
 - string representation, when they do not have special meaning due to their
 - context--of which the lexer is unaware.
