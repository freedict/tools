-- Notes:
--  * The string representations are chosen according to
--    Freedict/fd-dictionaries/shared/FreeDict_ontology.xml (short).
--    * If not found, annotated as UNCERTAIN.
--    * The existing dictionaries may serve as reference also.
--      * swh-eng is the only dictionary to contain <subc> elements.
--      * lat-deu is the only dictionary to contain <case> elements.
--    * Some could not be found anywhere and have been guessed/invented.
--    * See also <https://github.com/freedict/fd-dictionaries/wiki/FreeDict-HOWTO-%E2%80%93-Writing-A-FreeDict-Dictionary>.
--  * This module encompasses show* functions, which are similar to show, as
--    defined in `Show' instances.
--    * They are not defined in `Show' instances, because
--      a) The datatypes are shared between the Ding and TEI ASTs and it is
--         inconvenient to write two complete sets of Show instances by hand.
--      b) Some of the functions are not injective, they hide important
--         information, which is generally undesired for `show'.
--    * These problems do not exist for Usage.  (UsageType has no
--      representation in Ding; all other information is encoded as plain
--      string)
