{-|
 - The TEI AST.
 -
 - The types are quite closely related to TEI's XML elements (see
 - `Language.TEI.ToXML' on how they translate.
 -
 - This does only support a small subset of TEI (for dictionaries), as is
 - needed to represent the information that stems from the Ding dictionary.
 -
 - AST elements that are common to both Ding and TEI are to be found in
 - `Data.NatLang'.
 -
 - The TEI header is not explicitly represented, instead the Ding header type
 - is used.
