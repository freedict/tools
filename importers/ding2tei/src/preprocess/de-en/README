======

This directory contains preprocessor scripts, written in sed.
They should be applied before running the main program.


About
-----

The scripts are used to fix some irregularities before handling processing to
the main translating program.  Generally, only irregularities that are
assumed as mistakes are fixed.

Targeted at the German-English Ding dictionary, version 1.8.1 / 2016-09-06

Called with `sed -E' (see Shebang); i.e. extended regular expressions are
used.


Conventions
-----------
 * Use the g (global) specifier, for anything that seems likely to possibly
   occur elsewhere, even if it does not.  There might always be added another
   occurrence in a later version and `g' does not cost much.
 * Be as generic as possible and as specific as necessary.
   * Do not overgeneralize (e.g., "(n)" -> "{n}").  There may be legitimate
     uses of apparent misspellings / bad syntax.
     * Ex.: "to proffer sb. sth. /sth. to sb." -> "... sb. sth. / sth. to sb."
       * Bad: "sb. /sth." -> "sb./sth." (when generalized).
 * Use groups (<()>) and back-references (<\$i>).
 * Use <`> as separator to avoid the necessity to escape (/).
 * Use "\<" and "\>" where applicable.
 * On changes of this script, diff the result with the former result to check
   for erronous replacing.  This is usually doable in time.
 * When changing to another Ding version, review the diff (!) and check for
   new irregularities (optional).
 * Ideally, when grouping (using parentheses), group in an understandable,
   rather than an efficient way.
   * Ex.: "s`\<(to take)/ (to carry out) (a measure)`\1 / \2 \3`g"
     * Groups 2 and 3 could be merged.


Helpful tools
-------------
 * Regexes (grep/$EDITOR/less) to find common mistakes
   * e.g.: '\([^{]{0,10}\b(adj|adv|prp|n|m|f|...)\b' to find misusage of
     parantheses (instead of braces).
 * util/extract_braceexps.(sed|sh)
   * Analyze the output to find any irregular brace expression.
