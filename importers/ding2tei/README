ding2tei-haskell
================

A program to convert the Ding [0] dictionary into the TEI [1] format, to be
used within the FreeDict project [2].

This program was written as part of a Bachelor's thesis.  See doc/thesis.pdf.


Dependencies
------------

* main ding2tei program:
  * Haskell (Glasgow Haskell Compiler / GHC)
    * base
    * containers (Data.Map, Data.Set)
    * transformers (Control.Monad.Trans.{State,Writer})
    * pretty (Text.PrettyPrint)
    * haskell-xml (Text.XML.Light)
    * safe (Safe.Exact)
  * Happy
  * Alex
* preprocessing:
  * Bash
  * sed (with support for `-E`; e.g., GNU sed, OpenBSD's sed)
* `make` (optional)
  * GNU make
  * standard UNIX utilities (provided by, e.g., GNU coreutils)
  * curl (`make download-ding-1.9`)
  * xz (`make download-ding-1.9`)

On Debian-based distributions:

# apt install ghc libghc-xml-dev libghc-safe-dev happy alex bash sed make \
    coreutils curl xz-utils


Locale
------

Use a UTF-8 locale, otherwise some things might produce unexpected results or
even fail.  In particular, do not use the C locale.


Obtain the Ding dictionary
--------------------------

$ make download-ding-1.9

Alternatively, it can be manually downloaded from:

 https://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/Local/urz/ding/de-en/

and stored (uncompressed) at:

 dict/ding/de-en.txt


Build ding2tei
--------------

$ make

You may need to include `-dynamic` in HCFLAGS; e.g.:

$ make HCFLAGS='-O2 -Wall -dynamic'


Build TEI dictionaries
----------------------

$ make deu-eng
$ make eng-deu

Note: The main program (ding2tei) allocates a lot of memory, around 5.7 GiB,
      when applied to the full Ding dictionary.


Debug / Run ding2tei manually
-----------------------------

# TODO: make (alex, happy)
$ make haskell-source-files
$ ghci -i -ibuild:src -XRecursiveDo Test
>> parseLine $ scan "some dictionary :: line\n"
>> pretty $ parseLine $ scan (examples !! 0)
>> (Just ding, log) = parse $ scan $ header ++ (concat examples)
>> pretty ding
>> tei = ding2tei $ enrichDirected $ enrichUndirected ding
>> putStr $ prettyTEI $ tei
>> :q

$ ./ding2tei --help
$ ./ding2tei doc/examples/test.ding - | pager

Usage with the FreeDict tools
-----------------------------

To use the resulting TEI files with the FreeDict tools:

$ make -C dict/tei/lg1-lg2

Notes:
 * Above, lg1-lg2 should be either of deu-eng and eng-deu.
 * Memory usage of the FreeDict tools is even higher than that of ding2tei.
 * Running time is quite long (~ 1 day).
 * See <https://github.com/freedict/tools> for more information.

considered, since it allows combining with the AGPLv3.  (Likely, later versions
will also allow combining.)

The combination of the Ding dictionary and this program form a combined work,
the resulting TEI dictionary is an "object form" of this combined work, in
terms of both the GPL and AGPL.
