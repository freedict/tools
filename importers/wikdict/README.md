# WikDict TEI importer

Import TEI files generated by [WikDict] into FreeDict. These dictionaries contain data originally created at Wiktionary.

[WikDict]: http://www.wikdict.com 

## Usage

Go to the root directory where all the generated dictionaries reside (configured
under the section `[generated]` in your freedictrc) and execute

    $FREEDICT_TOOLS/importers/wikdict/import_wikdict.py

This creates new directories (or replaces existing ones) for the imported dictionaries. Then use make as for all other FreeDict dictionaries.
